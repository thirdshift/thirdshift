My name is Garrett Lee Hart. "3rdshift" and "thirdshift" are usernames I started using online in the 1990s. I decided to formalize them a bit and registered the domains 3rdshift.com and thirdshift.com in 1997 and 1998 respectively. I also set up thirdshift.com to act as the domain that I and my family use to send and receive emails. So if you happened to get here because you were wondering what kind of entities "thirdshift.com" or "3rdshift.com" are now you know. They are just old usernames for an old nerd.
